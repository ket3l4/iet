## Pathway
Some good ways to take courses. Recommended by professors and students from __IET__ and other engineering majors.

![Pathways](./assets/pathway.png)

### Definitions
1. __Opaque__ arrows - best path

2. Dotted arrows - a possible path ( for those who enjoy the _thrill_ )

3. Two-__headed__ arrows: Take the courses at the same time.

4. _Coloured_ course names - courses listed in the [IET Course map](https://www.eng.ntu.edu.tw/iet/cl_n_182556.html) 

5. __Black__ course names - courses __not__ listed in the [IET Course map](https://www.eng.ntu.edu.tw/iet/cl_n_182556.html). Taking these courses might help for understanding courses better and applying for a Master's since your background matches it.

## Tips & tricks

1. Study with a __Textmap__

Example:

For _Chemistry_, study with a mapped version of the book [Chemistry - The Central Science](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_Chemistry_-_The_Central_Science_(Brown_et_al.))

2. Dual Student Status

Be a 5th year Undergraduate student while also starting your Master's student.

You can then finish any credits you haven't from your bachelor's.
